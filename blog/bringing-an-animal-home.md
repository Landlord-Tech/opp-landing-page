If you’re looking to adopt a new pet, you’re not alone. According to an [article](https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/pets-appa-survey-covid/) by Today’s Veterinary Business, more than 11 million households have brought home new pets during the pandemic. But, before you head to your local animal shelter to adopt a new furry friend there are several things you need to consider, especially if you are living in a rental.

### Understand the Rules of Pet Ownership in Rental Spaces

If you live in an apartment complex or any other kind of rental property, understanding what the pet policies are on-site is imperative. Although more and more rental properties are catering to the needs of residents by becoming pet-friendly, there are still several rules and [restrictions to owning a pet in a rental](https://ourpetpolicy.com/resources/common-breed-restrictions-for-renters-and-what-to-do-if-your-dog-is-turned-away/) that you need to be aware of such as:

* Breed and weight restrictions
* Pet damage policies
* Rules for the common area
* Pet waste management and responsibilities 
* Noise, aggression, and complaint policies
* Pet rents, deposits, and/or fees

Services, like [OurPetPolicy](https://ourpetpolicy.com/), are available to help make it easier for both you and your landlord to work together and establish a mutual resident-landlord relationship. OurPetPolicy allows residents to complete their animal application form, file [veterinary records](https://ourpetpolicy.com/resources/do-you-need-to-keep-vet-records-8-instances-where-easy-access-vet-records-come-in-handy/), and upload pictures of their animal for a landlord’s review and acceptance. Having a unified platform for residents and landlords is the first and most important step to creating a successful living environment. 

### When You Bring Your New Friend Home

Now that you have had your pet application approved by your landlord using OurPetPolicy, it is time to bring your new friend home! Here are some tips to make the transition easier for your new family member as well as to ensure good behavior:

### Socialize

Show them around their new home and the common grounds. If your apartment complex is pet-friendly, socializing your new animal with others in the common area is a great way for your animal to learn how to play and be comfortable around others. The more comfortable your pet is around others, the less inclined it will be to develop aggressive behaviors and poor habits with people or other pets.

### House and Crate Train

Putting in the time to teach your pet proper pet waste practices, and where they can feel safe and secure while you are gone is important to establish right away. By keeping your pet on a consistent bathroom schedule, you can achieve a familiar routine that they learn to follow. Set a specific time to feed them, take them out for potty breaks, and a consistent routine for crate training, if you choose. Animals are smart and if you stick to your training routine, they will too. Training your pets from a young age can save you a lot of problems down the road, and money.

### Prevent Bad Behavior

Regardless of what type of animal you plan to bring home, you should be dedicated to caring for your new family member to the best of your abilities. Having a pet is a big responsibility. Biting, chewing, and scratching are some of the most common problems young pets may bring home with them. Without the proper attention and training, this could mean torn pillows, scratched floors, or chewed baseboards. Prevent this type of behavior from developing by providing your pet with the right toys that they need and by reprimanding poor behavior appropriately. 

### Reward Good Behavior

Having a stash of treats can be a secret weapon for every pet owner! Depending on your selected training methods, rewarding your pet with treats each time they listen and follow instruction can help reinforce good behavior. Negative reinforcement has been shown to lead to worse behavior so be sure to do your research on how you will properly train your pet. Positive reinforcement can also help promote overall happiness which leads to a more enjoyable and beneficial experience for you and your pet.

### Establish Pet Care & Grooming

Pets require proper grooming and care. Depending on what type of animal you are bringing home, they may need regular bathing, brushing, shampooing, haircuts, and nail maintenance. Find a grooming service near you that offers your pet everything that they need to stay clean, well-groomed, and taken care of. By doing so, your living quarters will see a reduction in pet hair, nail scratches, and dirt.

### Maintain Health & Wellness

Aside from the essential vaccinations and checkups for your pet at your established veterinary clinic, taking them out for regular exercise and playtime is crucial for your pet's overall well-being. Enjoying this time with them is a chance to bond and establish positive behavior while outdoors. A happy animal is less prone to accidents, poor behavior when you’re away, barking habits, and aggression - making these types of activities an obligation you must be prepared for when deciding to adopt a pet.

### Pet Training

It can be challenging to train pets and if you feel that you might need an extra hand in making sure your pet receives the best training possible, there are a lot of pet training services available. Take a look at the services near you, and give them a call to see how they can help guide you in your pet training process.

### Are you ready for the responsibility?

Owning a pet is a big responsibility – especially at a rental property. Consider all the facts before committing to the decision to adopt a pet unless you are ready to dedicate time and effort into training your new furry friend. If you’re not sure what the pet application process is at your rental, be sure to contact your property management company beforehand to ensure you are taking the proper steps in becoming a new pet parent.
