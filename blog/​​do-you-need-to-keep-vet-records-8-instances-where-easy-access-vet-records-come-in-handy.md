We’ve all been in that situation where we’re checking out at the vet after a long, exhausting visit. You’ve finished paying and your veterinarian is handing you a paper record or says something about records being emailed to you. Unfortunately, you have no idea what to do with them.

That’s likely why you’re reading this blog—to find out if keeping your vet records is a necessity or if you’re okay to simply throw them out.

We’re here to explain not only that keeping your vet records is a MUST, but also to give you some information on situations where vet records are needed. Here are 8 instances where easy-access vet records come in handy: 

### \#1: Applying for Pet Insurance

Pet insurance is an excellent way to save money on costly vet bills, but you won’t be able to finish your application through any reliable insurer without vet records! 

This is because insurers like to make sure that their policyholders are both responsible and that the animal is in a condition where pet insurance is going to be the right option for them. Without easy-access vet records, though, you can end up dragging your application out over weeks as you try to recover them, or never be able to complete your application at all! 

### \#2: Determining What Type of Care or Treatment is Needed

Consider what happens when you take a trip to the doctor’s office: 

If it’s your first time there, they ask you a bunch of questions about your medical history and have you fill out forms regarding those records. This helps them determine what illness you may have by narrowing down the possibilities. For example, if you’ve never been out of the country, it’s extremely unlikely you have something like Malaria. 

Medical care works the same way with pets. Depending on what animals they’ve encountered and what vaccinations they have, their course of treatment can change. Having easy-access vet records can get them the proper care as quickly as possible.

### \#3: If Your Pet Bites Somebody

Having your pet bite someone is an absolute nightmare, and just because it happens doesn’t mean you’re a bad owner. Tons of factors can go into a pet suddenly getting aggressive. 

Regardless of why it happened, though, you’re going to want to have those records at your disposal when/if it does. Without having records that state that your dog has vaccinations for things like rabies, you can find yourself fighting in civil court against a lawsuit or even in criminal court against negligence charges!

### **\#4: Providing Vaccinations Records to Property Management** 

If you’re a renter, you’re already familiar with the hoops you’re required to jump through in order for your pet to be able to live with you. Nearly all places have some type of pet deposit/fee, and some even require DNA samples from them if they are an animal who frequently goes outside! 

Another thing property management requires, however, is vaccination records. Without having easy-access vaccination records, you can find your application dragging out for weeks while you try to procure them. Depending on the property, you could also be barred from living at that rental. 

### \#5: Moving to a New Rental

Similar to number 4, moving to a new rental almost always requires some form of vaccination records for your pet. Areas where there is a communal pet park are especially strict about this so that other animals are kept safe. 

### \#6: Keeping Track of Check-ups

Just like people, animals need to go to the vet every so often for general check-ups and shot boosters. However, if you don’t have your previous vet records easily available, it can be difficult to know when to schedule those appointments. 

By keeping up with your vet records, you can easily track when that next booster shot is due or when your pet is ready for a wellness visit. 

### \#7: For Travel

Just like most other establishments, airlines are incredibly strict about taking animals onto their planes. To be able to do so, you are responsible for providing all relevant vet records in a timely manner. Fail to do so, and you could be denied permission to fly! Additionally, many places that you stay will require those records as well. This goes for places such as hotels, Air BnBs, etc. 

For a smooth trip, we definitely recommend keeping your vet records within reach. 

### \#8: In Case of Emergency

Nobody wants there to be an emergency where medical records are needed. Circumstances like this do happen, however, and there’s little we can do to prevent them. 

When they happen, though, the best thing you can do is to be able to access those vet records at a moment’s notice. This will help your vet quickly diagnose your animal and provide them with the emergency care they need.  And in an emergency, every second counts.
