faqList:
  - faqQuestion: What if I have a question about how to use this platform?
    faqAnswer: If you have questions about how to use this platform click here to
      see a tutorial. If you have other questions that are not answered in these
      FAQ’s please fill out the “Contact Us” form or email us at
      ***[info@ourpetpolicy.com](mailto:info@ourpetpolicy.com)*** and we will
      get back to you ASAP.
  - faqAnswer: If your lease addendum allows pets go to the applications page and
      select the “pet application”. It will outline all the documents and
      details. If you need to add an Emotional Support Animal, go to the
      applications and select the “ESA Application”. It will have outline the
      documents and steps needed to complete the application. **We highly
      recommend not using an online vendor selling ESA letters as most are not
      legitimate according to HUD guidelines**. If you need to add a Service
      Animal to your addendum, you can find that application as well on the
      applications page.
    faqQuestion: What if I want to add an animal to my contract?
  - faqAnswer: If you notice other tenants that might be breaking rules (sneaking in
      unauthorized animals, not cleaning up their animals poop, excessive noise,
      etc) please report that as a violation and if possible upload a picture,
      video, or audio recording to show the landlord exactly what is happening.
      This way the landlord can fix the issue immediately and make your renting
      experience as good as possible!
    faqQuestion: When would I “Report a Violation”?
  - faqAnswer:  In the applications section there is an application for an animal
      visitation. This must be filled out in advance and approved to allow the
      animal onto the property. If an animal is on the leased premises and not
      approved, it can result in an “unauthorized animal fee”.
    faqQuestion: What if a friend/family member is coming to visit and wants to
      bring their animal?
